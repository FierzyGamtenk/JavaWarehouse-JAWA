Therefore, I have crafted a Java file that incorporates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for warehouse management. Feel free to utilize this code within your own project or application. Use it as a reference or seamlessly integrate it into your existing file according to your specific needs. This implementation is designed to facilitate the manipulation of warehouse data efficiently.
